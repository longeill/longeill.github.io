					<p class='bg-white p-2'>📌 Well. I hate to say it but I'm definitely going to rebuild this site already. I'll put all of this in the /old/ directory when I begin but this is a couple days out. I've decided to keep focusing on learning JS before I keep digging too deep with this site. I'm consistently making the site my main focus and my intention was always to make this second to learning. For now, it'll stay up in its broken state. I figure I'll begin work on it again in a week or two. 👍 </p>
