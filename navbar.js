// This file goes against what I wanted to do with this site, which is make everything myself. But I needed to be able to have users
// navigate so I had it generated via ChatGPT through multiple iterations trying to get the links to dynamically pull from GitHub. 
// This kept causing issues because the data wasn't pulling correctly. After missing my bedtime by hours I finally asked it at 3:30am
// to let me make the values myself in a separate JSON file and gave it the structure I wanted for it. Outside of needing to waste
// 2 hours of vacation time by coming in to my job late it worked like a charm. 7/16/23-7/17/23

// jk. It didn't work on anything in the projects/ directory at all. Every time I tried to iterate on this with GPT it made it worse.
// Destroy, Rebuild.

// Ok, in fairness, this was much more complicated when I first generated it. I think I could have made this by myself but got
// lost in the sauce trying to make something fancy work.
